things to have in the environment generator:
	function_set vs interpreter vs environment
	declare, declare_with_name
	auto_call, input_reprint, error_print
	use function sets with or without namespaces, templatable function sets such as util
	cfn, sfn, mfn, mbr, refto, constrefto, copier, pick
	specialize extended_util, type_operation_info, name of a type, parsing/printing, wrapper_type_operation_info

needs to be able to express:
	create namespaces for groups of added functions
	automatically parse c++ identifiers into expression evaluator safe names
	choose between not declaring a class, declaring it with a generated name, or declaring it with a chosen name
	declaring into a specific type_info_set
	should member functions be preceded with the name of their class somehow?
		should it be with the name found in the used type_info_set?
		should it be auto-generated? (what if it isn't declared and typeid().name gives an invalid name?)
	provide parsing and printing methods for a class
	provide interclass casts (from cfn) with automatic or chosen names.
		maybe each class declaration (where members are listed) should state the ability to cast to some types
	a generic way to deal with class and function template arguments
	a generic way to refer to specific instanciations of functions
	a way to import function sets
	a way to import packages (e.g. std::vector function sets, name declaration etc)
	a way create the packageness of a new class, e.g. describe it



there are 3 kinds of objects that can be generated:
function sets only have functions of various types
environments have the same and some more special localized functions
and interpreters have all of that and some extra options, input and output stream pointers, and a pointer to a runtime typeinfo database


a generic file will look like:




code:
	//arbitrary c++ code, possibly just including a few header files or defining macros that are necessary for some reason
	include"folder/myheader.h"
	include<string>
	include"C:/boost/include/boost/python.hpp"
	int foo = 3;
	class bar
	{ int mem; };
	void baz(){ foo = 7; }

returntype functionname resultingfilename:
	values:
		//constants or values to be cached once and copied from that one value (copier)
		:foo
		pi:3.141592
		get-nan:get_nan()
	refs:
		//references to point to
		:foo
		cout:std::cout
		:myvec
	constrefs:
		//references to point to without write access
		:foo
		int_t:typeid(int)
		myvec-const:myconstvec
	rfn:
		//already generated callables
		garb:some_environment.garbage_getter()
		funcs:some_environment.functions_printer(names, output)
		funcs:functionname_ret.some_special_function(args) //only works when returntype is an environment
	sfn:
		//function_pointers, lambdas, invokable/callable objects
		:&baz
		zero:[](){return 0;}
		:&system
	mfn:
		dothing:&my_manual_function
		core.swap:&core::swap
		core.drop:&cpp_core::drop
	class classname:
		(optional name):declare
		(optional name):util
		sfn:
